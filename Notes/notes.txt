Active Job is a framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queueing backends.

******************************
Active Job is an interface to queueing backends such as sidekiq, delayed_job or resque.
 It's simply a way for you to write background jobs where you don't have to care about which of the queueing backends will be used.


******************************

rails g job first_job

*****************************

gem 'sidekiq'

 config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
